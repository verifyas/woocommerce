## About

### Verify
Verify is a reputation protocol that tracks the transaction history of participants (buyers, sellers) and unlocks benefits for those with good reputation.

### WooCommerce
WooCommerce is the most popular eCommerce platform on the web. With 35 million+ downloads, WooCommerce powers almost one-third of all online stores. 

## Getting Started

Using Wordpress and WooCommerce for your store? That's great -- we've set this plugin up to make it incredibly easy for you to start accepting cryptocurrency payments in your online store. This includes Bitcoin and Ethereum for now, but we're striving to add more popular currencies in the near future. The best part? You **won't have to re-integrate new cryptocurrencies**! This plugin uses the Javascript library that automatically pulls the latest version of Verify for each transaction -- making updates *instant*.

Here's what you'll need to get started:

- Your `private_key` and `public_key` from Verify. You'll need these keys to make calls to [the Verify API](https://docs.verify.as/). If you don't have any, contact [team@verify.as](mailto:team@verify.as) to get your keys.
- A functional wordpress installation, running at least version v4.0
- WooCommerce (this is a WooCommerce plugin after all!)
